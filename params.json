{"name":"astropy-tutorials","google":"","body":"## Introduction\r\n\r\nThese [IPython](http://ipython.org) [notebooks](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/ipython/ipython/master/docs/examples/notebooks/00_notebook_tour.ipynb) are a tutorial-style introduction to the [astropy](http://www.astropy.org) Python package.\r\n\r\nAstropy has excellent tutorial-style and reference [documentation](http://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/). The advantage of these notebooks is that you can execute and start playing with the examples directly without having to copy & paste the code into IPython.\r\n\r\nIt would be best if we find a way to generate IPython notebooks from the RestructuredText tutorial-style astropy documentation (or the other way around) to avoid creating and maintaining two versions of the same content (see [this ticket](https://github.com/astropy/astropy/issues/574)).\r\n\r\nAstropy currently doesn't do plotting, so we use [aplpy](http://aplpy.github.com) to plot astronomical images.\r\n\r\nAll of these notebooks are very much (as Astropy itself) work in progress and feedback / contributions via issues and pull requests on github are very welcome!\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Notebooks\r\n\r\n* Using  [Astropy](http://www.astropy.org) from [IPython](http://ipython.org)\r\n([view html](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/gammapy/astropy-tutorial/master/using_astropy_from_ipython.ipynb),\r\n[download ipynb](https://raw.github.com/gammapy/astropy-tutorial/master/using_astropy_from_ipython.ipynb))\r\n* Overview of [Astropy core packages](http://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/)\r\n([view html](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/gammapy/astropy-tutorial/master/astropy_packages.ipynb),\r\n[download ipynb](https://raw.github.com/gammapy/astropy-tutorial/master/astropy_packages.ipynb))\r\n* Overview of [Astropy affiliated packages](http://affiliated.astropy.org)\r\n([view html](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/gammapy/astropy-tutorial/master/astropy_affiliated_packages.ipynb),\r\n[download ipynb](https://raw.github.com/gammapy/astropy-tutorial/master/astropy_affiliated_packages.ipynb))\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
